# file_client
A minimal file server-client based on Akka Http making Http client calls to its counter part file_server.
The project has been built keeping in mind, a service that can be built within approx 4-5 hours.

###  Requirements: Create HTTP service (client) with a single endpoint:

GET /api/client/get-or-create/{{requestId}}
which
1. retrieves the value of a resource from the upstream service (server) as soon as it becomes available or with a delay of max 500ms
2. stores the value in a file
3. no longer calls the server if a resources is available in a local file and responds with the value
from that file
4. client service should throttle requests for a specific resource (as per server rate limit - never
more than 2 requests / second / resource)
5. The endpoint responds immediately with either

Output:
A:
HTTP response code 202 (Accepted) if the resource value is not yet available
or B:
{"requestId‚Äù: "{{S1}}", "fileContent": "{{S2}}"} - if the resource is available in a local file
